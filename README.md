            <p id="img-caption">Is there a more famous rabbit in the world? Bugs Bunny has been making people laugh with
                his
                catchphrase
                "What's
                up, Doc?" since he made his debut in the 1940 Warner Brothers cartoon "Wild Hare." Whether he's poking
                fun
                at
                stuffy highbrow culture in the 1957 classic "What's Opera, Doc?" or outwitting a nasty knight in the
                Oscar-winning 1958 short "Knighty Knight, Bugs," that rascally rabbit Bugs Bunny always gets the last
                laugh!
